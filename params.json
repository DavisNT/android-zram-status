{"name":"ZRAM Status","tagline":"Android ZRAM Status","body":"### Description\r\nAndroid application to show ZRAM status. If you don't know what is ZRAM, than you probably doesn't need this application.\r\n\r\n### What is ZRAM (quoted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRam)):\r\nzRam is an experimental (staging) module of the Linux kernel. It was previously called \"compcache\". zRam increases performance by avoiding paging on disk and instead uses a compressed block device in RAM in which paging takes place until it is necessary to use the swap space on the hard disk drive. Since using RAM is faster than using disks, zRam allows Linux to make more use of RAM when swapping/paging is required, especially on older computers with less RAM installed.\r\nEven though the cost of RAM hardware is relatively low this feature still offers advantages for netbooks and other lower-powered laptops, virtualization and in the case of embedded devices, especially those that use flash memories that have a limited lifespan, dependent on write-use and thus wear out quickly when used as a swap device.\r\n\r\nCAUTION: Use only with ZRAM enabled device and kernel.\r\n\r\n### Known working devices\r\nKnown works on:\r\n* Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S (should work with other Xperia 2011 too) latest stock ROM.\r\n* Latest Lupus Kernel for Xperia.\r\n\r\nSource code available at https://github.com/adhisimon/android-zram-status for free.\r\nZRAM Status is distributed under The BSD 3-Clause License.\r\n\r\n### Bug report and feature request\r\nPlease submit your bug report or feature request on [GitHub](https://github.com/adhisimon/android-zram-status/issues/new).
